# ClawSwitch - Captain Claw port based on OpenClaw project

This port was possible thanks to:
- pjasicek - creating the OpenClaw project
- mialy - adding basic controller support
- denispapec - implementing basic level 11 support

You can find the original OpenClaw project here: https://github.com/pjasicek/OpenClaw

# Bugs

- in-game music does not play (unsupported format?)
- analog controlls are wacky
- not all levels are yet implemented by OpenClaw project

# Compilation

You will need to have libnx installed with all needed libs (see Makefile). To start the compilation, simply enter:
```
make -j4
```
