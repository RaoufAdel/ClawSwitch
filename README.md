# ClawSwitch - Captain Claw port based on OpenClaw project

This port was possible thanks to:
- pjasicek - creating the OpenClaw project
- mialy - adding basic controller support
- denispapec - implementing basic level 11 support
- usineur - adding background music support
- fgsfdsfgs - porting fluidsynth to the Switch
